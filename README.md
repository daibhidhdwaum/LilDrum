Wes Bos - Watched his tutorial for inspiration. Loved how simple his approach was but wanted to ensure I was taking it in my own direction. 

Sherry - For pointing me in the right direction with the multiple audio input instances.

Asaf - For helping me resolve my animation and related event firing issues. Also for highlighting the challenges faced when declaring your variables globally.
